# Image-Upscaler üöÄ

This project provides a web application for upscaling images using advanced AI techniques.  It allows users to upload images and receive higher-resolution versions, significantly improving image quality. The application is built using a modern Python framework, focusing on efficiency and scalability. This README provides comprehensive instructions for setting up, configuring, and using the Image-Upscaler application.  Future development will include support for additional upscaling models and advanced features such as batch processing and custom model integration.


## Features ‚ú®

*   **Image Upscaling:**  Upload images and receive significantly higher-resolution outputs.
*   **AI-Powered Enhancement:** Leverages advanced AI models for superior upscaling quality.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**  Intuitive web interface for easy image upload and download.
*   **Multiple Model Support:** (Future Feature)  Ability to select different AI upscaling models.
*   **Batch Processing:** (Future Feature)  Process multiple images simultaneously.
*   **Custom Model Integration:** (Future Feature)  Support for user-provided custom models.
*   **Progress Tracking:** (Future Feature) Real-time progress updates during upscaling.
*   **Secure Authentication:** (Future Feature) User authentication and authorization.


## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Image-Upscaler.git
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run Migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```


## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

1.  Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser after starting the server.
2.  Upload an image using the provided interface.
3.  The upscaled image will be generated and displayed.
4.  Download the upscaled image.


## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The application relies on environment variables for configuration.  Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and set the following variables:

*   `SECRET_KEY`:  A secret key for secure session management.  Generate a strong random key.
*   `DATABASE_URL`:  The URL for your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).  Refer to your database documentation for the correct format.
*   **(Future) MODEL_PATH`: Path to the AI model file.
